# Miavarium recipes

This repository is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) course

It is a small project about creating and structuring recipes in a plain webiste using
only HTML. This project helped me grasp the concepts of using images,links, attributes,
unordered and ordered lists and keeping a git workflow in mind.
